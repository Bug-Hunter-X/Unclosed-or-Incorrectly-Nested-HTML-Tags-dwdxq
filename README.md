# Unclosed or Incorrectly Nested HTML Tags

This repository demonstrates a common error in HTML: unclosed or incorrectly nested tags.  Unclosed tags lead to layout issues, and incorrectly nested tags can cause unexpected behavior in the browser.

The `bug.html` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.html` shows the corrected version.

## Bug Description

The primary issue is the improper nesting and closure of HTML elements.  Failure to properly close tags or incorrect nesting interrupts the DOM structure resulting in incorrect rendering and potential JavaScript errors.

## How to reproduce the bug

1. Open `bug.html` in a web browser.
2. Observe the unexpected layout or behavior.

## Solution

The solution is in `bugSolution.html`, which demonstrates correct tag closure and nesting practices.

This example is designed to highlight the importance of meticulously structuring your HTML code to avoid common layout issues and to improve web development practices.
