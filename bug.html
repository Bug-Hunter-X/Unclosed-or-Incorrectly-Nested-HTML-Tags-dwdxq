<p>This is a common error in HTML, but can be hard to debug:</p><code><div> <p>This is some text.</p> </div></code><p>The problem is that the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element is not closed. It needs a closing tag, like this:</p><code><div> <p>This is some text.</p> </div></code><p>Another, less common but more difficult, error is to nest tags incorrectly:</p><code><div> <p>This is some text<span>This is more text</span></p> </div></code><p>The above is correct. But this is wrong, and can lead to unexpected results:</p><code><div> <p>This is some text<span>This is more text</p></span> </div></code><p>In this case, the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag is incorrectly nested within the <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> tag. It should be outside.</p>
